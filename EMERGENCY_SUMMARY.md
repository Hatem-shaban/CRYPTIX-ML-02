# Emergency Recovery System - Simplified

## Files Created (Only 2 Essential Files)

### 1. `recovery_status.py`
**Purpose**: Monitor ban status and provide guidance
- Real-time ban countdown
- Automatic recovery detection  
- Continuous monitoring mode
- **Usage**: `python recovery_status.py` or `python recovery_status.py --monitor`

### 2. `post_ban_launcher.py` 
**Purpose**: Safe bot restart after ban lifts
- Automatic ban detection
- Environment validation
- Safe startup sequence
- **Usage**: `python post_ban_launcher.py` (will wait automatically)

## Configuration Changes (Existing Files Enhanced)

### `config.py`
- Added `EMERGENCY_MODE = True` flag
- Ultra-conservative API limits (30 calls/min vs 1200)
- Emergency delay between calls (2s vs 0.05s) 
- Simple WebSocket price fallback function (inline)

### `web_bot.py`
- Emergency startup check (prevents restart during ban)
- Automatic emergency mode detection
- Safe startup messaging

## Recovery Process (Simplified)

1. **Check Status**: `python recovery_status.py` (~11 minutes remaining)
2. **Wait for Recovery**: Automatic at 09:56:56
3. **Safe Restart**: `python post_ban_launcher.py` (recommended)
4. **Monitor**: Watch logs for first hour

## Smart Code Reuse Implemented

- ✅ Consolidated WebSocket function into config.py (no separate file)
- ✅ Used existing config flag system instead of separate flag files  
- ✅ Enhanced existing web_bot.py instead of wrapper scripts
- ✅ Deleted 5 redundant files (kept only 2 essential)
- ✅ Reused existing datetime/time utilities
- ✅ Leveraged existing environment validation

## Result: Minimal, Efficient Emergency System

**Before**: 7 new files + modifications
**After**: 2 new files + smart config enhancements

The system is now streamlined, reuses existing code patterns, and provides the same safety with much less complexity.
