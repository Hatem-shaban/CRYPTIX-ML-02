signal = signal_generator(df, symbol)  # Now includes ML analysis

# Trade execution uses ML position sizing
execute_trade(signal, symbol)  # Enhanced with ML intelligence
```

### Manual Training
```bash
# Train ML models with real market data
python enhanced_ml_training.py

# Validate trained models
python validate_ml_models.py

# Test ML integration
python test_ml_integration.py
```
